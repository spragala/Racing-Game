# Matt Sprague Racing Game
A simple racing game made with Jquery and Bootstrap CSS. The rules of the game are simple. Spacebar moves Putin and the return key moves trump. Whichever head hits the "nuke" button wins and they destroy the world!

## Built with
Bootstrap 3.3.6
JQuery 2.2.3
javascript
HTML 5
CSS 3
and love.

## How it works
The images move with the Jquery "animate" function. When the left side of the image gets to 370 pixels less than the window width the animation stops. Whichever head got to that point first is the "winner." It triggers an "h1" to append onto the body declaring who has destroyed the world.
